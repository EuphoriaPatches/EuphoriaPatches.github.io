Welp, I did it again, another huge update - the biggest one yet :)
### Changes
- Updated to Complementary r5.5
- Added a new option in the Euphoria Colored Lighting option which makes it possible for the screenspace and ACL variants to work together.
- Rewrote how settings are handled internally - many setting changes are applied very quickly now, some instantly - also normal Complementary settings
- Clouds change height automatically in dimensions such as the aether now - works with all cloud types.
- Screenspace colored lighting works with entities and beacons now as well (if one has a dynamic lighting mod)
- Added a new Full Sky Celestials option to have star related effects, (nebula and stars) as well below the horizon line! Sun and moon will be visible on both sides only if Sun/Moon horizon is disabled
- Added a new fun option: Entities Are Light, enjoy!
- Added leaf block voxelization if ACL is enabled and floor leaves are enabled, this prevents said leaves to cause false positives under cliffs and cave entrances! Thanks to [@FoZy STYLE](https://github.com/FoZy-STYLE)
- The end crystal beams are no longer limited to 10 chunks thanks to [@gri573](https://github.com/gri573)
- In honour of our Subsurface Scattering Community, Snow SSS has been significantly improved. It will no longer blind you while still having the noticeable SSS
- Improved the Pixelate Camera option
- Added new settings for the Pixelate option
- Improved directional lightmap normals option a lot, they no longer cause a bloom apocalypse when the lightmap curves are tweaked
- Darkness desaturation in the nether has been improved a lot
- Added a clear Water Spots option for Unbound or Reimagined + waves which adds random spots to the water where the water waves are calm, giving the water some more variation
- Improve the look of the autumn season floor leaves drastically
- Added the unreal and another uncharted2 tonemap
- Added a second customizable Unbound cloud layer thanks to [@FoZy STYLE](https://github.com/FoZy-STYLE)
- Added a caustics strength slider (1.13+ only as I didn't want to trial and error test 1.12 now)
- Added a dark lava edge as a new option (side effect: lava edge setting got reset)
- Improve lightmap normals at the light source block thanks to [@FoZy STYLE](https://github.com/FoZy-STYLE)
- END_SKY_FOG_INFLUENCE now also affects beam color and so on and not just the sky (only relevant for non-vanilla end biomes)
- Improve the light source fade underwater of the darkness desaturation effect
- Improve the look of Patrix grass block models. Interactive foliage also works with these extra block model additions. Thanks to [@gri573](https://github.com/gri573) for the help
- Made snow noise and other overlay noise work on diagonal modded blocks
- Improve season snow handling in dry biomes and its overall color and noise and also its transparency
- Improve snow color with Snow SSS during the night
- Made the cactus flower emissive with emissive flowers
- The sides of grass blocks now also tint to the floor leaf colors
- Improved the red autumn color, it was too saturated
- Improved performance of world blur sneak - dof is now actually disabled when not sneaking
- Removed all duplicates from the properties files, they were over 600! Yes, 600 a huge pain.
- Behind the scenes EP mod improvements in the shader
- Auto detect transparent modded fluids and make them get the water block ID if they are not in block.properties
- If your GPU supports more precise dFdx functions it will use the more precise versions for lightmap normals now (I think it works?...)
- Improved the text renderer by Sixthsurge and added background and character padding
- Added a text description on screen for every color coded program. Very useful for debugging - it no longer is needed to look what color is what in the code.
- Improved automatic modded light sources with a minimum intensity so that they give some glow regardless of light level.
- Added an in-game shader update message via the next version of the Euphoria Patcher mod
- Added an error message for the screenspace colored blocklight if used on older MC versions where it doesn't work
- Added an error text if ACL is enabled without real-time shadows
- Huge block.properties changes thanks to [@Eclipse](https://github.com/Eclipse-Sol) making 1.12 and 1.13+ separate sections
- Many different cloud options have received more values to choose from
- Ender dragon beam intensity and end sky intensity also received more values
- Separated sun and moon glare intensity into separate options
- Darkness Desaturation render distance fade received nether and end counterparts
- Added an ACL ore intensity option
- Added an end crystal emission intensity setting
- Added generated normals entity intensity multiplier
- Added an option to disable spring in dry biomes
- Remove duplicate emissive flower settings tab
- Improved the Darkness Desaturation timing
- Added Moon phase influence for Darkness desaturation thanks to [@Acer (Alex)](https://github.com/djmrFunnyMan)
- Added a second cloud layer speed multiplier setting, works for unbound and reimagined clouds
- Added an extra floor leaves in forest setting for EP autumn
- Improved custom lightmap curves with blocks like grass (new setting has to be enabled to get lightmap curves to work again)
- Remove season snow in dry biomes
- Require a spyglass in hand for the Sneak DOF and the DOF Focus Viewer settings to work (this is to prevent regular users from complaining)
- Static noise can now have 0 speed to not move
- Hiding the GUI with the grid option hides the grid
- Added darkness desaturation removal to Distant Horizons light sources
- Screenspace Colored lighting works with Distant Horizons now
- Improved ACL light with darkness desaturation. Now the entire ACL light will not be desaturated, most noticeably with redstone ore
- Sand and moss overlay when set to "everywhere" no longer fade out away from the player
- Lowered the emission of azalea flowers in the bushes and leaves with emissive flowers turned on
- Improved the wording of the EP license
- Added more modded blocks to the properties files thanks to the contributors
- Significantly improved abandoned Japanese translation thanks to [@MUKSC](https://github.com/MUKSC)
- Updated translations thanks to the contributors
