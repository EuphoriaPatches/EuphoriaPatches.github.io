### Changes
(Please also check the Mod changelog, MANY changes over there)

- Updated to Complementary Shaders r5.7 [YOUTUBE SHOWCASE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RD-sQ4Ar9A0)
- Drastically improved the Epic Thunderstorms option, now we got thundier thunder! Clouds randomly light up during a thunderstorm (iris and oculus exclusive)
- Many new aurora settings! Including: Scale, Swirlyness, Saturation and Dominant Layer
- Added all PixelCraft features to Euphoria Patches!
- The Blood Moon has been moved to its own menu and has been improved by a significant amount. It is truly epic now.
- Added a new aurora Preset: Aurora smooth daily which smoothly changes colors of the aurora to the next one within the same day. It can change between 0 and 2 times per night based on randomness, yet still synced between different players on multiplayer
- Added an aurora probability setting, which allows you to tweak how probable it is to see an aurora at night
- Added new and better aurora colors thanks to @zanderest
- Stellar view and cealum working out of the box
- Added Reimagined 2nd cloud layer settings + unbound 2nd layer transparency
- Added cloud shading related options to invert it and also customize it much further
- Improved cloud sun/moon shading to give clouds some self-shadowing effect
- Added a rotate clouds 90 degrees option for Reimagined clouds - useful if you change the cloud direction
- Added more values for reimagined cloud width
- Added an opaque tinted glass option
- Added support for fullbright mods
- Added lower values for camera noise overlay
- Made sun/moon shading individually configurable into sun, moon and both
- Added a new Aurora Condition in the regular Complementary Settings - Always Except New Moon condition. Usually not what I do but I could not be bothered to make an entire new option just for that
- Added a new nebula moon condition - Always Except New Moon
- No rain above clouds code is now MUCH cleaner
- Moved the main menu around to make it more clearer for the user
- Make the existing Underwater Surface Reflection Strength option work with WSR
- Separate ACT fog rain intensity from epic thunderstorm
- Made the Deeper Darker Oceans slider a bit more intuitive
- Better ACES sun color and also better ACES default white amount
- Made the End Center Lighting only work starting on Minecraft 1.9 since before the portal was random and not centered
- Remove Spooky Settings since it was outdated and unmaintainable code and I will be adding individual options in the future for things which better fit Euphoria Patches.
- Added Angelica CurrentRenderedItemID and watermark support
- The purkinje effect now works on the hand with Angelica
- Added the half resolution reflections also to Angelica
- Tweaked the popular settings profile

- Updated translations thanks to the contributors <3

### Fixes

- Fixed colored light fog having the incorrect color when the dragon is alive at the end center with End Center Lighting enabled

- Fixed broken lightning detection
- Fixed Clearer Sky During Rain not working correctly
