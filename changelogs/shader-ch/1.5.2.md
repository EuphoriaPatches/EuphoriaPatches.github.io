### Changes
- Improved handheld generated normals by a lot. It now works as intended without any visual artefacts. It does not make the Handheld lighting brighter/darker than intended. Normals even react depending on the hand you have the handheld item in!
- Added the resin armour trim
- Added error messages for dragon death effect, end crystal vortex and end portal rays if they are used on Apple or Optifine without creating compile errors.
- Added more modded blocks to the properties files thanks to the contributors :catCare:
