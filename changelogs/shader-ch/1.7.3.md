### Changes
- Added a new option "ACT + SSBL + Dynamic Lighting Support" and removed the dynamic lighting mod support from the standard ACT + Screenspace since it breaks in modded scenarios
- Improved the Lava noise from lava presets no longer reaching full pitch black, it was too strong before
- Updated translations thanks to the contributors <3
- Added more modded blocks to the properties files thanks to the contributors <3
### Fixes
- Fixed the physics mod ocean physics not working. The mod auto detects Complementary and injects code into it to make it work, I broke the detection in 1.7.0 dev versions, just fixed it again
- Fixed Screenspace Colored Lighting breaking with ACT + SSBL + Dynamic Lighting Support with modded light sources not in the properties files near water
- Fix End Beams reflecting in blocks when the option is disabled
- Fixed rain from the Particle Rain mod being bright with motion blur on
- Fixed waypoint names from Journeymap mod being black in Distant Horizons chunks
