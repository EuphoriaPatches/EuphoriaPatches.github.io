### Fixes

- Fixed particles glowing INSANELY bright with a tweaked lightmap curve
- Fixed the end portal colors being slightly off

- Fixed a compile error which broke the shader if colored light fog was turned off and the end portal rays turned on
- Fixed all false positives with the dragon death effect on iris 1.7.2+ (the effect no longer works on iris 1.7.1 so make sure to update)

- Fixed Reimagined clouds not becoming fully transparent as it was intended with the transparency slider
- Fixed Reimagined night cloud removal not working as intended
