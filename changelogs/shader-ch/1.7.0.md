- Added a new End Center Lighting option

- Added DOF shapes, from triangle to octagon. With configurable sample points to create more unique shapes
- Added new Lens Flare Shapes also from triangle to octagon and a way to rotate the shapes

- Improve the darkness desaturation effect on volumetrics, for example end crystal vortex or the end center lighting
- Added a smoke particle opacity setting - default at 0.5
- If you have either Dragon Death Effect or End Crystal Vortex set to both then the ender dragon detection will behave correctly with distant horizons and for example make the ender beams orange if the dragon is alive

- Made Deeper Darker Oceans have an intensity slider and fixed it having odd lighting sometimes
- Made the Cave Lighting Fade option behave as an intensity slider now
- Added a rain fade timer, you can configure how fast the transition from sunny to rainy is when it starts raining, changes affect clouds, rain puddles and so on (Iris Only)
- Improved the world curvature option - now a bit less bad (especially with colored lighting which did not curve at all prior to this)
- Move the frozen time option lower in the world tab as it's more of a debug option or for screenshots rather than a gameplay feature
