And time for another big update!

### Changes

- Updated to Complementary Shaders r5.6

- Added shooting stars which are also configurable as usual
- Add native Colorwheel support! Huge thanks to [@djefrey](https://github.com/djefrey)! Enjoy create v6 with good fps!
- Added a new End Center Lighting option
- Added an End Flash Shadow option which projects the shadows from the 1.21.9 end flashes, Iris only
- Added a custom Euphoria Patches End Flash - Especially useful for those who disabled End Beams, again Iris only 1.21.9+
- Added Blocklight Caustics as a new feature - makes ocean monuments so much cooler
- Add a Cloud Sun/Moon Shading Setting which makes clouds shine at the position of the sun/moon thanks to [@FoZy STYLE](https://github.com/FoZy-STYLE) for the base implementation
- Added heat distortion in the nether as a new feature
- Added many new nebula related settings! They can be pixelated now and their colors can be changed and so on!
- Make ACT Colored fog work with Darkness Desaturation and make said fog more intense while raining with Epic Thunderstorm option enabled
- Added a new portal noise effect
- Added an end shadow sun angle slider
- Added DOF shapes, from triangle to octagon. With configurable sample points to create more unique shapes
- Added new Lens Flare Shapes also from triangle to octagon and a way to rotate the shapes
- Added Anamorphic Lens Flare with intensity
- Improve the darkness desaturation effect on volumetrics, for example end crystal vortex or the end center lighting
- Added a smoke particle opacity setting - default at 0.5
- If you have either Dragon Death Effect or End Crystal Vortex set to both then the ender dragon detection will behave correctly with distant horizons and for example make the ender beams orange if the dragon is alive
- Added an Unbound Cloud Shadow Size Setting
- Made Deeper Darker Oceans have an intensity slider and fixed it having odd lighting sometimes
- Made the Cave Lighting Fade option behave as an intensity slider now
- Added a rain fade timer, you can configure how fast the transition from sunny to rainy is when it starts raining, changes affect clouds, rain puddles and so on (Iris Only)
- Improved the world curvature option - now a bit less bad (especially with colored lighting which did not curve at all prior to this)
- Move the frozen time option lower in the world tab as it's more of a debug option or for screenshots rather than a gameplay feature
- Added an ACES brightness rolloff slider to control how bright ACES can get - this was a common complaint about it and now it can be tuned down a bit
- Made translucent blocks in Distant Horizons chunks work with Screenspace Colored Lighting, they will now tint light the correct color now
- Fix DH glowstone detection not working making it green with Screenspace Colored Lighting
- Fix DH torches not glowing and improve Screenspace Colored lighting on DH chunks with translucent blocks, before it was incorrect

### Fixes

- Fixed the rose bush having an incorrect emissive pixel with emissive flowers enabled
