### Changes
- Updated to Complementary Shaders r5.6.1
- Added a new Lava Preset option: Chaotic Flow
- Improved the current Adaptive Lava Preset (my favorite), lava pools in the overworld got reworked and also all lava noise in the nether
- Lava noise from lava presets can no longer reach full pitch black; thus, the lava texture underneath will now be able to shine through
- Improved how lava behaves with Distant Horizons and also made the lava noise from lava presets move down in DH lava columns, previously they stayed static
- Improved screenspace color lighting now sometimes having a more accurate color than before
- Made Cave Smoke not activate underwater
- Add a skin animation for SpacEagle17 (aka me ^^)
- Updated translations thanks to the contributors <3
- Added more modded blocks to the properties files thanks to the contributors <3

- Fixed second unbound layer jumping in position when crossing x/z 0 coordinates
- Fixed particles not rendering with world curvature
- Fix cloud shadows being too dark and cloud transparency setting not working correctly
