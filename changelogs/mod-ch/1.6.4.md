### Changes
- Updated to Complementary Shaders r5.5.1 + Euphoria Patches 1.6.4
- The mod will now identify the iris-reserved folder as a mod folder if it was installed via the Complementary Installer
- To make it also work correctly with the COmplementary Installer it now will be able to correctly modify zip files as well which it wasn't able to do before as it assumed the shader to be a folder

### Fixes
- Fix the mod not recognizing Euphoria Patches as a zip file. Now it will mark it as already installed if found
