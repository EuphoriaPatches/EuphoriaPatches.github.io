### Changes
- Updated to Complementary Shaders r5.3 + Euphoria Patches 1.4.2
- Added an option to delete outdated Euphoria Patches versions
- The mod will check if the user by accident still has an older version of the mod in the mods folder. The older version will realize it is the older version and not run any code and the newer version will delete the older version automatically
### Fixes
- Fix the mod sometimes stopping early during the extraction process because of a logic error
