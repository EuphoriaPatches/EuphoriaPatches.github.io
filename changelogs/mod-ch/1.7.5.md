### Changes

- Updated to Complementary Shaders r5.6.1 + Euphoria Patches 1.7.5
- Improved the logging of the Mod again by a LOT when an issue occurs
- Switched to the Modrinth API for the update detection, much easier to have all in one place.

## Fixes

- Fixed compile errors in the auto-generated error shader if a log line is left empty
