### Changes

- Added the ability to patch the other shader style after EP is already installed. For example: if the user has Reimagined Euphoria Patches installed and later installs Unbound, it will now patch Unbound as well (previously it would not).
- Made the mod a multi-loader setup. This changes nothing for users, but makes development significantly easier. It reduced the time to release an update from around 30 minutes down to only 3 minutes.
- Added Mixin support for Forge, enabling Iris code injection to improve the user experience behind the scenes and fix obscure bugs.
- Made the byte size check at least 4x faster by using threads. The system is intelligent and can even run on more threads depending on your CPU core count. This means that if users renamed Complementary Shaders, the mod will now find it almost instantly instead of taking a while, since it can scan in parallel.
- Made the update checker much more advanced: automatic major + minor checks and recommended patch version checks in the current patch cycle, fully automated via the Modrinth API. The recommended patch version check exists to alert users when a very important bug is fixed.
- Migrated the Euphoria Patches config file to TOML, with a proper migration system so no existing config files break.
- Mixed into Oculus to add scrollable text like modern Iris versions have, so the Euphoria Patches shader name no longer overlaps with buttons.
- Added a much cleaner way to detect the mods directory, using the actual path from where this JAR is running.
- Added Iris, Oculus, Angelica, and OptiFine detection via class checks rather than file name checks. This removes false positives and checks which mod is actually loaded in memory instead of relying on file names in the mods directory - much more reliable and way less cursed.
- Now only inject the shader loader version via defines. Previously, actual shader code was edited while patching, but now Forge Mixin support is used. The shader loader version defines are needed to fix weird Oculus 1.7 bugs.
- Made it safer against typos when users see the error shader and need to type in a URL by automatically copying it to the clipboard on modern Forge, NeoForge, and Fabric. If copying fails, it tells the user to copy the URL from `_0EUPHORIA_PATCHES_ERROR_LOGS.txt` in the error shader.
- Added an Iris EP button in the Iris options menu which shows the support link and changes to the update one when an update is available. It only shows up in shaders which are actually Euphoria Patches.
- Added caching and early exits everywhere, literally everywhere where needed. This ensures much faster operation by no longer re-evaluating expressions and constant events, such as the currently used shader loader mod.
- Support Forge down to Minecraft 1.8 instead of 1.8.9.
- Already added Fabric 26.1 Mojang mappings and Yarn separation.
- Added support for old Forge MCP (<= 1.16.5) mappings.
- Improved dimension handling with defines. Now every dimension name is parsed as a define, not only Nether, Overworld, End, and Other.
- Added a new EP define to differentiate whether a dimension is in the `dimensions.properties` file or not. Currently not used, but who knows.
- Improved Potato.
- Updated the shader description which appears when using my other mod [Iris/Oculus Shader Folder](https://modrinth.com/mod/iris-shader-folder) when an update is available.
- Detect Euphoria Patches dev versions and skip the patching process. If a user has a more modern dev version than the version the mod would patch, it goes into an accepting state and skips patching. This also works when already in shaderpack watcher mode after no matching shader was found during first run.
- Renamed the package.
- Improved the error shader with “hide GUI” text, as things like minimaps might overlay the error messages. Users are now advised to hide the GUI.
- Cleaned the code a LOT. Like, a LOT A LOT. A rewrite in many places.
- Added more debug logging.

### Fixes

- Fixed it also unzipping version control folders, meaning the verification step is faster when looking at folders.
- Fixed the error shader having too many error messages. If there are too many, it now stops logging them to the error shader.
- Finally fixed the error being thrown if `shader settings.txt` is being updated but already exists with that name (this always happens when testing).
- Fixed the outdated renamer/deleter affecting “earlyDev” versions.
- Fixed `Locale.ROOT` not being used everywhere it should be.
- Fixed `isAlreadyInstalled` not being passed down to `createAlternativeShaderNames`.
