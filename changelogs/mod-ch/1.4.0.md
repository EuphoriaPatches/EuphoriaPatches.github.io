### Changes
- Updated to Complementary Shaders r5.3 + Euphoria Patches 1.4.0
- Auto Settings Updater:
    - The Mod will automatically detect the latest settings version you have (let's say from EP 1.3.2) copy that file and rename it to work with the newer Euphoria Patches version (1.3.2). Will not do anything if you already have a 1.4.0 settings file.
- Auto Base Shader Settings Transfer:
    - If you have never used EP before but have used the normal Complementary versions and have settings files there, the mod will automatically copy the latest version of that settings file and have it automatically be applied to Euphoria Patches!
- Auto Shader Applier:
    - The Mod will detect if you were using an older version of Euphoria Patches and only then apply the new version in Iris/Oculus/OptiFine settings automatically 
- A config file was added where you can disable all te new features if desired
- Forge now works from 1.13+
- Update Checker:
    - The mod will now check if a new version is available by checking against the latest release tag in https://github.com/EuphoriaPatches/PatcherUpdateChecker and modify the current in use Euphoria Patches version to display an update message!
- Auto Rename Old Versions:
    - Old Versions of EP will automatically be renamed so users know which version to take if they can't read the version number (yes, that happens)
- The entire code got cleaned up and rewritten and made more modular and organized
- Changed the mod versioning to be the same as the shader versioning
