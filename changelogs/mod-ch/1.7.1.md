### Changes
- Updated to Complementary Shaders r5.6.1 + Euphoria Patches 1.7.1
- Removed the color code from the Error Shader and the "Outdated" Shader to prevent java Path crashes because of ยง color code char when other mods want to get the current shaderpack via Path. You can install my client side mod to make them red again on Iris/Oculus and since it's client side it won't have any java Path issues: [Iris/Oculus Shader Folder](https://modrinth.com/mod/iris-shader-folder)
- If the user deletes alternative shader names, no longer regenerate them
