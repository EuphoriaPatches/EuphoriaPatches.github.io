### Changes

- Updated to Complementary Shaders r5.6.1 + Euphoria Patches 1.7.1
- Removed the color code from the Error Shader and the "Outdated" Shader to prevent java Path crashes because of § color code char when other mods want to get the current shaderpack via Path. You can install my client side mod to make them red again on Iris/Oculus and since it's client side it won't have any java Path issues: [Iris/Oculus Shader Folder](https://modrinth.com/mod/iris-shader-folder)
- If the user deletes alternative shader names, no longer regenerate them
