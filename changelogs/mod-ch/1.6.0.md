### Changes
- Updated to Complementary Shaders r5.5 + Euphoria Patches 1.6.0
- Added automatic patching without needing to restart the game. If the patching fails, it will auto detect file changes in the shaderpacks folder and attempt to patch again. Once patched it will stop watching the folder
- Make the patching work as well with renamed Complementary zip files. It could be a.zip, the mod will detect it via byte size to be the Complementary zip, look inside to see if it's Unbound or Reimagined, rename it to the correct one and then do the patching.
- Make the EP mod inject code into iris (legacy with coderbot naming scheme and modern) for new features:
    - Display a shader update toast if a new update is out only at game startup which fades away if the player moves - this is done via said iris injection and then I can detect it on the shader side and display something
    - The current dimension is now also set as a global define with the Euphoria Patcher mod, meaning that one can do checks for a dimension in shaders.properties which is impossible usually. This means that entity shadows will only be forced on in the End with the dragon death effect or the end crystal vortex effect, without that mod version current behavior remains.
- Improve logging messages all around to make things clearer for the user
- Shadowjar all dependencies - prevent crash with the Kotlin Extensions mod
- If the shader style is not in the name, look inside the shaderpack at common.glsl to find it now
- Sodium pop-up logging works again with all sodium versions this feature is compatible with! And also on Neoforge!
- Add a log file which will be created in the shaderpacks folder if the patching fails and it will contain the relevant info. No need to search for it in latest.log anymore
- Made the mod initialize even earlier in the game starting process
- If using a mixin and it fails to load, suppress the warnings as mixins are not essential for the patching process and said warning is just annoying
- Add a shaderloader detection
- Add a line to the Euphoria Patches settings files to indicate that they are for Euphoria Patches so that the mod can identify them in the future even if they are renamed.
- Also added a line indicating in which Euphoria Patches version said settings file was made in. Used to sort renamed settings files
- Made it possible to change config options without having to restart the game
- Added a doDebugLogging setting which enabled a LOT of debug logging
- Generalize some hardcoded internal checks for future Rethinking Voxels integration
- Cleaned the code up again a lot
- Improved the update message GUI button on Oculus and Optifine
- lowered fabric loader requirement

### Fixes
- Make the already installed check work if the base file is gone.
- Fix game crash on Forge 1.8.9
