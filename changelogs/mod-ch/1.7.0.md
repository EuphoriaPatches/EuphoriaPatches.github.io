### Changes
- Updated to Complementary Shaders r5.6 + Euphoria Patches 1.7.0
- Added a procedural error shader generator, if you get an error at the patching process of Euphoria Patches, a new shaderpack will be generated which displays in-game the issue you encountered and how to solve it. Once the errors are solved, the error shader will be replaced by the patched Euphoria Patches.
- Automatically detect OptiFine and Mac and then modify the popular settings profile in such a way so that they can use it without any issues, for example disabling Advanced Color Tracing
### Fixes
- Fix old iris files no longer being detected
