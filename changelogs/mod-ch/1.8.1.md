Please look at the 1.8.0 changes, this is just a small bugfix update.
### Changed
- Improved the error shader message when the correct Complementary Shader is not found at boot

### Fixes

- Fixed fabric dimensions switcher mixin not working
- Fixed the update notification reappearing when entering a different world with the same dimension, now shaders are always reloaded at any dimension switch to fix this.
