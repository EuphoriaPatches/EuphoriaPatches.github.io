### Changes
- Updated to Complementary Shaders r5.3 + Euphoria Patches 1.5.0
- Made a compatible version for 1.8.9 - 1.12.2 Forge
- Made a compatible version for 1.7.10 Forge
- Added the Euphoria Patches Version number in the config file
- Minor changes and additions + cleanup

### Fixes
- Fixed CurseForge deleting Euphoria Patches shader files when updating a modpack by checking if files were deleted, and if this is the case, regenerate the shaderpack
- Fix temporary files accumulating by deleting them after they are no longer needed - I assumed windows would handle that but it will only delete temp files after your disk is almost full...
- Fix a very rare crash at shaderpack generation
