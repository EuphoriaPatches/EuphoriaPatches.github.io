### Changes

- Updated to Complementary Shaders r5.5.1 + Euphoria Patches 1.6.6
- Fixed an issue where the mod wouldn’t work if a pre-patched version of Complementary (e.g., Colorwheel) was installed. Since the patched version appeared first in the list, the mod tried to patch it instead of the original Complementary, which it can’t handle. The mod now skips any file with a “+” in its name, so it ignores Complementary + Colorwheel and correctly patches the original file.
- Added a way to get the version of the shader loader through the file name, that way I am able to detect Oculus 1.7.0 and do a workaround of it being broken and fix the issue on the shader side when oculus 1.7.0 specifically is installed
- Added a way for the mod to detect installed Euphoria Patches even if renamed, meaning that it won't generate a new Euphoria Patches folder if the user has it already installed but just renamed it
- Improved the logging again to make it more user friendly
- Now also remove "(copy)" and so on from file names when patching
- Added a config option alternativeShaderNames, which generates additional shader copies after Euphoria Patches has been applied. This is useful for creating different presets you can quickly switch between. Supports multiple comma-separated names and placeholders like {baseVersion} and {patchVersion}.

### Fixes

- Fixed an early exit not showing relevent logging info to the user, that early exit no longer exists and now in some cases users should receive better log messages
- Fix not adding version identifiers to the top of the shader settings files if no settings got converted, now it always should add it
